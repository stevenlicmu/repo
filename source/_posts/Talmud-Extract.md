I will write down something I felt interesting during my reading of 'Talmud'.

Read a story about how to manage your month. 

A single word you said is like an arrow you shooted. There isn't an another chance to re-do. 

Be careful of what you said. Because in most cases, words are much important than works. 

Long time ago, a man was introduced to the king. He promised the king that he would help the king to get a special medicine. 

After a long-time work, he finally got the special medicine -- the milk from a female lion. 

Then the organs of the man were in a fierce debate. They argued who should be credited for such achievement. 

The mouth said: I am the one who dominates all of you. And I will prove this. 

The other day, when the man met the king, his mouth said: My dear king, here is the femeal dog milk I got. 

The king was very angry and wanted to kill the man. At this time, the other organs gave in. They acknowledged that the mouth was the most essential role. 

After reading this story, I cannot stop thinking. Obviously, the brain was who made this idea and the hands were who did the actual works. However, if you did not pay attention to your words, you may lose anything you did before.
